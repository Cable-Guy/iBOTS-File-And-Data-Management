# iBOTS-File-And-Data-Management

## Agenda

- **Day 1**:
  - **Morning**: Organizing Structured filename data into Dictionaries.
  - **Afternoon**: Navigating and Searching through Local and Remote Filesystems

- **Day 2**:
  - **Morning**: Analyzing JSON-, CSV, and Parquet data using SQL in DuckDB
  - **Afternoon**: Organizing and Analyzing Data stored in HDF5 using h5py.


## Workshop Description

Neuroscience is evolving rapidly, with experimental data becoming increasingly complex. How can you seamlessly integrate vast and diverse datasets for insightful analysis and easy sharing? And how would your process improve if, instead of having to write long scripts, you could analyze data with just a few lines of code?

In this workshop, discover the power of database management systems, a game-changer in neuroscience research. We will dive into the world of SQL and learn about DuckDB SQL engine, which makes it easy to apply industry-standard data organization methods to research data as a relational database â€“ no server management needed! You'll also gain hands-on experience with HDF5 and JSON for key-value data storage and learn how to combine various management techniques for optimal convenience and performance by building hybrid database systems.

By the course's end, you'll be adept at writing Python scripts to create and extract data from databases, query large databases in SQL, store complex data in HDF5, manage your work with Git, and publish your projects on GitHub.

Prerequisites: This workshop is ideal for Neuroscience Researchers at any level (Masters, PhD Candidate, Postdoc, PI) with some background in data analysis using Matlab, Python, or R.
